#### Application where college students can enter the same code and they are taken into the same group chat room where they can share information,  2021.1.13
#### By **Vincent Kipngeno**
## Description
This application will enable college students to communicate with each other on a single platform. It will give them the facility to chat and share important notices through it. There will be a login page for the users and a code to join the same group. The development of this application can be done using Android Studio, Java, and XML. For this, even Kotlin can be used instead of Java. This app is specifically targeting a group of people and not anyone to one chat. The users would be provided with a login/signup page. Once they register on the app, theyâ€™ll be ready to enter the chat room with a code. After they enter the chat room, they can communicate and share the data. The data will be stored locally in the device using SQLite.
